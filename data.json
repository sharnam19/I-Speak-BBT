to me.", "I'm fine.", "Okay, if you're going to drink on this date just promise me you won't overdo it.", "Yeah, that.", "Uh, why don't you bring her to my restaurant when I'm tending the bar so I can keep an eye on you?", "Drinks do not work that way.", "Okay.", "Oh, I'll wedge it right in there.", "I know the reason.", "Oh, maybe a couple of virgin cuba libres that turned out to be kind of slutty.", "Hey, you do your experiments, I do mine.", "Hey guys.", "It's a little loud.", "Okay, thanks.", "Yeah, you turned your stereo down with your laptop.", "Oh.", "You know you can just get one

other?", "Oh, hey, I didn't know they still made corduroy suits!", "Okay, well, let's just see what else you have.", "Okay, here, take this, and this, and this, and these.", "No, this is stuff I want you to throw out.", "Seriously, don't even give it to charity, you won't be helping anyone.", "What's this.", "Uh-huh.", "Oh, nice.", "Here, why don't you put these on while I find a shirt and sport-coat to match.", "Well, where you going, just put them on.", "Oh, are you shy?", "Don't worry, I won't look.", "Sweetie, put the pants on.", "So, you know, isn't there maybe some way you and Sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing.", "What is this?", "Oh, why didn't you wear it at Halloween?", "Okay, alright, moving on, oh, wow, a paisley shirt.", "If you mean it should end up in the same place then, I agree.", "Is this your... your only tie?", "Oh, sweetie, I don't think it even works as one.", "Is this all your clothes?", "The... the eighth grade?", "Okay, well, I guess we're back to the corduroy suit.", "Yup.", "(Leonard picks up paisley shirt) I said no, put it down.", "Hey Sheldon!", "Get anything good?", "Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and

climb) Put it in your pocket.", "So you and Leonard...", "Little misunderstanding, huh.", "Anyway, I was talking to Leonard this morning and I think he feels really bad about it.", "Well how do you feel?", "Well I'm just asking if it's difficult to be fighting with your best friend.", "Wait... what?", "You should just talk to him, I'm sure you guys can work this out.", "Which was?", "Okay, so you absolutely should talk to him, look, I know Leonard values you as a friend, and he told me himself that without your little idea there's no way he could have come up with this whole experiment thing.", "Yeah, I mean he tried to explain it to me, I didn't really understand it but...", "Uh, well no, no, not in... not in those words.", "Um, gee, the exact words aren't written... it's more the spirit in which it's", "You had a lucky hunch.", "Leonard, ready to go?", "Bye Sheldon.", "There you go.", "No, no, I didn't say better, I said less stained.", "Is that all?", "Oh, well, then good!", "Oh, sorry, I've just, I've heard it before.", "I really should have brought my own car.", "Is this usually how these physics things go?", "Howard, would you like to explain to me why your facebook page has a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned \"Me and my Girlfriend?\"", "Let's go-oh-oh Ou-oooo-ut tonight.", "I have to go-oh-oh-oh ou-ooooo-ut tonight.", "You wanna prowl, be my night owl, (Leonard and Sheldon reappear, running down the stairs) we'll take my... (appearing) Hey guys, hi!", "Where you going?", "You'll never guess what just happened.", "What was that?", "Alright, remember when I auditioned for that workshop production of Rent, but I didn't get it and I couldn't figure out why?", "Well, the girl they picked to play Mimi, she dropped out and they asked me to replace her.", "It's not a big deal, just a one night showcase, but they invite a lot of casting people and agents so, you never know.", "It's this Friday at eight, you guys want to come?", "Oh, too bad, well, I got to get to rehearsal, see you guys.", "Do you have any idea what time it is?", "What do you want?", "I remember symposium.", "Wait, what?", "Well imagine how I'm feeling.", "Thanks.", "I just wanted to come by and wish you guys luck with your symposium.", "You know, I got to tell you, a lot of friends would let their friend go alone, but that's not who you are, you are the kind of guy who stands by a friend when... when he has a symposium to go to.", "Uh-huh!", "Uh-huh!", "Howard, wait.", "Sheldon, I think we should tell them.", "There's no symposium, Leonard lied to me, isn't that right Leonard.", "It's okay, I do, look, Leonard is helping Sheldon through a family crisis, he made up the whole story about the symposium with Dr Farmin..farm...ian", "Hah, yeah!", "Because he didn't want Sheldon to be embarrassed, and there is nothing to be embarrassed okay, every family in America has a relative holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner.", "No, look, Sheldon's cousin Leo escaped rehab, and he's in a Motel 8 at Long Beach, the whole family's going out for an intervention.", "Leonard is driving Sheldon down there to help him through this because he's such a good man.", "Alright you guys, good luck.", "Hi.", "How did the intervention go.", "Well, based on what you told me, I'm not surprised.", "Hi Leo, how are you feeling?", "No.", "Oh, it was okay I guess, wasn't a big turn out but they both really seemed to like it.", "By the end.", "Yeah.", "I'm... I'm sorry.", "Yeah.", "Hey, do you want to come over to my place, have coffee?", "I have a video of me singing last night, do you want to see it?", "This is even better than you coming to the showcase, because now I get to watch you watch me.", "Leo, you are a very sweet, really funny guy.", "You're gonna do okay.", "Hi guys.", "Did you get my mail.", "Oh, better than North Dakota!", "(Pause) I guess that joke's only funny in Nebraska.", "Boy, it's good to be back.", "Ugh, it was the worst trip, everyone got sick over the weekend.", "Oh, the flu I guess.", "Maybe Friday.", "I... I don't...", "Oh, it's okay, I understand.", "Okay, well, thank you for getting my mail.", "No, just crazy.", "Sheldon, what are you doing here?", "How could you have gotten it from me, I'm not sick.", "Shhh!", "Sheldon, what do you want.", "Why didn't you just....", "(louder throat clearance) Why didn't you just have soup at home.", "You can have soup delivered.", "Okay, what kind of soup do you want.", "We have Chicken Tortilla and Potato Leek.", "No.", "Hey, where are you?", "You sound funny.", "Yeah, well I'm at work too, and you'll never guess who's here infecting my entire station.", "He won't leave, he says he's afraid he'll pass out on the bus and someone will harvest his organs.", "Can you please come get him?", "Oh, it's okay, I didn't really need to work today, it's not like I have rent or car payments or anything.", "Okay, well, you feel better.", "Um, home, to write some bad cheques.", "Sheldon, you are a grown man, haven't you ever been sick before?", "Really, never?", "Studying abroad?", "And there was no-one there to take care of you?", "Again?", "What does that mean?", "Okay, sweetie, I'll take care of you, what do you need?", "Okay, ground rules, no sponge baths, and definitely no enemas.", "Okay, nice and cosy, okay, I'll see you later.", "Oh, Sheldon, can't you do that yourself?", "But Sheldon....", "I can't believe I'm doing this.", "Sorry.", "What?", "I'm sorry, honey, I don't know it.", "Soft kitty, warm kitty...", "Little ball of fur.", "You rat bastard.", "You deliberately stuck me with Sheldon.", "Uh, it's okay, sweetie, good news, Leonard's home!", "Here you go, good luck, bye.", "Mmm, this is really delicious, isn't it?", "(Raj looks uncomfortable, then nods.)", "Still can't talk to me unless you're drunk, huh?", "(Shakes head) Oh, sweetie, you are so damaged.", "Sure.", "Raj, hug Howard.", "I'm confused, did Sheldon stop giving milk?", "So, you've got a bit of competition, I really don't see what the big deal is.", "I don't understand, exactly how did he get any friends in the first place?", "You know, I'm confused again, is he waiting, or do we get to shoot him between the eyes?", "Oh, hey guys, what's up?", "What?", "Hi, can you help me, I was writing an email and the A key got stuck.", "Now it's just going \"aaaaaaa\".", "Nothing.", "Diet coke.", "And yoghurt.", "A little nail polish.", "Wow, so

apparently I didn't have anything else to do on a Saturday afternoon, and isn't that just a little sad?", "Gentlemen, are you ready?", "You know, it's none of my business, but isn't a guy who can't speak in front of women going to hold you back a little?", "Oh, thanks Raj, it's vanilla oil.", "Okay, the first question is on the topic of optics.", "What is the shortest light pulse ever produced?", "Dr Cooper.", "That is correct.", "Good for you, sweetie.", "Okay, next question.", "What is the quantum mechanical effect used to encode data on hard disk drives?", "Howard.", "Right.", "Because it's polite.", "Leonard, you said I only had to ask questions.", "What did he say?", "Yeah, and the bag it came in.", "So, how do you feel?", "Nice and loose?", "Come to play?", "Got your game face on?", "(The guys look confused.)", "Are you ready?", "Oh, no, no, I want to.", "It sounds really interesting.", "Sheldon.", "I'm just going to sit down.", "Okay, new contest.", "I'm settling

different in a good way.", "Obviously my usual choices have not worked out so well.", "But on the other hand, if things don't go well with Leonard, I risk losing a really good friend.", "I mean, I guess he's not looking for a fling, he's the kind of guy that gets into a relationship for, I don't know, like you would say light years.", "Thank you for the clarification.", "Right, thanks.", "Not the first one I've made today.", "Sheldon, do you have anything to say that has anything to do with, you know, what I'm talking about.", "Schrodinger?", "Is that the woman in 2A?", "Sheldon!", "I'm

nudity, orgasms and human contact.", "Now, Raj, kill Sheldon.", "Well then start throwing grenades.", "That will do, Raj, straight for the tank.", "There's a sniper, use your rocket launcher.", "I thought I heard something.", "No, never mind, alright, go.", "Problem?", "Okay, now, do you really need the honorary Justice League of America membership card?", "Why?", "Hi.", "Hi!", "Yeah, we're not like Haroun and Tanweer!", "Actually, I read somewhere that it's one of the most popular programmes in India.", "I bet you're right.", "I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I love that show.", "What?", "Well, maybe we are like Haroun and Tanweer.", "Hey, I thought you were finding new friends.", "So don't call her.", "So call her.", "I'm done, anybody else?", "Look on the bright side, she might turn out to be a nice, beautiful girl.", "Oh, hey.", "His mom's been saying that for years.", "What's up?", "Oh, great, well the key to acquiring proficiency in any task is repetition.", "Look, Penny, we'd love to help you, but Raj is going through some stuff right now.", "And besides, he doesn't drink, so... (Raj whispers in his ear) Really?", "Um, Raj is going through some stuff right now and he'd like to take up drinking.", "Thank you.", "This drink is a wonderful example of how liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical container.", "Thank you.", "Whatever you recommend.", "It's amazing.", "Um... Raj.", "Wait a minute, what's the plan here?", "Let's say he meets her and he likes her and they get married, what's he going to do, stay drunk for the rest of his life?", "You have a drink that'll make him less obnoxious?", "What happened?", "What?", "I'm pretty sure her name's Lalita.", "We all know the reason.", "Sheldon, what are you getting at?", "Beats the hell out of me.", "Doctor and Mrs Koothrappali, in all fairness, it wasn't entirely Raj's fault.", "No, I'm Leonard.", "You left with his date.", "Friends don't do that to each other.", "Take it, Raj.", "It's more than I've ever gotten.", "Hold on.", "What happened with you and Lalita?", "So you're not going to see her again?", "I wonder who's going to tell his parents they're not having grandchildren.", "I don't believe it, what's gotten into him?", "You didn't?", "Okay, the X10s are online.", "Hang on, hang on, do you not realise what we just did.", "No, no, no, you don't get it, um, Howard, enable public access.", "No, hang on, hang on.", "(The lamp goes off and on again.)", "See!", "Wireless webcams, wave hello.", "Who's running the red Corvette?", "Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?", "It's from the Institute for Experimental Physics.", "They want us to present our paper on the properties of super solids at the topical conference on Bowes-Einstein condensates.", "Okay... if I may drill down to the bedrock of my question, why did you throw it out.", "Forget the parties.", "Are there any other honours I've gotten that I don't know about?", "Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?", "Shut up, Howard.", "Sheldon, we have to do this.", "Okay, let me put it this way, I'm doing it.", "Oh, come on.", "The only reason you're the lead author is because we went alphabetically.", "Excuse me, I designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis.", "So the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word?", "Alright, I don't care what you say, I'm going to the conference and I'm presenting our findings.", "You forbid it?", "Oh, you admit that it's our work.", "Ah!", "Not only is he still not talking to me, but there's this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode.", "You know, like in the classic sci-fi movie Scanners?", "(Put's fingers to head) You know, bzzz-pchew!", "Never mind.", "How about this one.", "It says, \"I know my physics, but I'm still a fun guy!\"", "They don't, that's why I saved this one.", "Is this all stuff you want me to try on?", "Oh.", "Oh, that's the bottled city of Kandor.", "You see, Kandor was the capital city of the planet Krypton, it was miniaturised by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by Superman.", "It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it.", "Great, be right back.", "Here?", "No, I'm not shy.", "I know you won't look, why would you look, there's nothing to see, well, not nothing....", "Putting them on.", "No.", "No.", "Scientists do not compromise.", "Our minds are trained to synthesise facts and come to inarguable conclusions.", "Not to mention, Sheldon is batcrap crazy.", "Oh, careful.", "That's my original series Battlestar Galactica flight suit.", "Because it's not a costume, it's a flight suit.", "Uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit.", "Ah.", "Technically yes, but, if you'll notice, it's reversible.", "So it works as two.", "Yeah.", "Everything since the eighth grade.", "My last growth spurt.", "Great.", "Hey, Sheldon, I've been thinking, instead of arguing about this why don't....", "Okay, I'm leaving for the conference.", "Sheldon I didn't mean it like that.", "I don't know, I wasn't choosing my...", "No, no not at all.", "A little bit.", "Okay, I'm going to ask you one more time, we did the work together, lets present the paper together.", "Let's go.", "You're right, this side does look better.", "You're kidding.", "All?", "In particle physics, twenty five is Woodstock.", "I wasn't expecting such a crowd, I'm a little nervous.", "A joke.", "Okay.", "How about this, um, okay, uh there's this farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won't lay any eggs.", "So, he calls a physicist to help.", "The physicist then does some calculations, and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum.", "(Raj and Howard laugh.)", "Right?", "It's a classic, right?", "So, in conclusion, the data show that at temperatures approaching absolute zero, the moment of inertia changes, and the solid becomes a super-solid, which clearly appears to be a previously unknown state of matter.", "(Applause) Thank you.", "(Penny is asleep on Howard's shoulder.", "Howard is taking a photograph with his camera phone.)", "Are there any questions?", "Any other questions?", "I didn't skip it, it's just an anecdote.", "It's not science.", "You are not Isaac Newton.", "You cannot possibly be that arrogant.", "Look, if you weren't happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me.", "Really, so why did you come?", "I didn't screw it up.", "I've had enough of your condescension.", "Maybe I didn't go to college when I was eleven like you, maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16, but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room.", "No offense.", "And I am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation.", "Yes.", "(To audience) My name is Dr Leonard Hofstadter, and I could never please my parents so I need to get all my self-esteem from strangers like you.", "But he's worse.", "You cannot blow up my head with your mind.", "Stop it.", "You were trying to blow up my head.", "It wasn't, it was not, you are a nutcase.", "Vulcan nerve pinch!", "You're lucky I didn't run you over.", "You're right, I'm the problem, I'm the one that needs help.", "Excuse me.", "Is there anything you'd like to apologise for?", "What?", "Oh jeez.", "Is this suit really look that bad?", "See, the liquid metal Terminators were created in the future by Skynet, and Skynet was developed by Miles Dyson, but that future no longer exists, due to Dyson's death in Terminator 2.", "Skynet is kinky?", "I don't know.", "Alright, oh wait, they use it to in...", "What the hell is that?", "Oh, I give up.", "Believe it or not, personal growth.", "What happened?", "No you don't.", "No he doesn't.", "Oh, congratulations, what a lucky break.", "No you don't.", "He doesn't.", "Because....", "uh, Friday, we are attending a symposium on molecular positronium.", "No, it's this Friday, at eight.", "Yes, I did.", "So?", "Sheldon, are you worried about your safety.", "That's very true.", "What?", "It's two o'clock in the morning", "I highly doubt that.", "Go away.", "(Long pause).", "Are you still out there?", "What?", "What, what, what, what, what?", "Sheldon, what is it?", "What was I supposed to say.", "That would have hurt her feelings.", "Yes.", "And what would I have said afterwards?", "I couldn't say that, I would have to say, you were terrific and I can't wait to hear you sing again.", "It's the social protocol, it's what you do when you have a friend who's proud of something they really suck at.", "Well now you are.", "Yes.", "Oooaw.", "This would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath.", "(Opening door) What?", "How?", "You told her I lied, why would you tell her I lied?", "I'm sorry, I'm not seeing the help.", "Oh, I'm getting a bad feeling.", "Your cousin Leopold?", "What's important?", "Do you have a cousin Leopold.", "I don't get it, I already told her a lie, why replace it with a different lie?", "Un-unravelable?", "Okay, why would I go to a drug intervention for your cousing.", "We're going to Long Beach?", "Oh, come on!", "So he goes back into rehab?", "You still told her I lied.", "I don't know.", "How am I supposed to remember all of this.", "So she's expecting me to lie about going to a symposium in Pasadena, when in actuality we're pretending to go to a drug intervention in Long Beach?", "Oh hey Penny, wow, look at you, all ready for your showcase, you look great.", "Oh, well, thankyou.", "I don't know what to say.", "Oh, okay, alright, good.", "Howard, I'm sorry... we're... we're", "I don't know what to say.", "Howard, listen...", "Well... I don't know what to say.", "Oh, another hug, thank you.", "Thanks Penny.", "No, we're not going to Long Beach.", "Because Sheldon doesn't have a drug addicted cousin Leopold.", "Wait, are we really going to Long Beach?", "Let it go, Sheldon, the murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not.", "What are you talking about, it's fine, she bought it, it's over.", "Why not?", "There is no Leo, how can you say that?", "I've got a solution.", "Get out.", "Who are you?", "Oh, God!", "Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo.", "Sheldon?", "Yeah, I got it, Sheldon, why?", "Oh...!", "Well, that's Leo.", "Hey, um, why don't you tell me about your showcase last night?", "There were only two people there?", "As you can see, detoxing can get pretty ugly, let's give them some privacy.", "Sounds good.", "Gee, why wouldn't I?", "Yeah!", "Funny how things work out.", "How long is he going to stay here.", "O-o-o-o-h!", "Again?", "Just reset the board.", "Hey!", "Yeah, right here.", "How was Nebraska?", "How was your family?", "Here we go.", "Sheldon, relax, she doesn't have any symptoms, I'm sure she's not contagious.", "Penny, you'll have to excuse Sheldon, he's a bit of a germophobe.", "You'd better go before he starts spraying you with Lysol.", "What the hell are you doing?", "With lime jello?", "I don't think so.", "Sheldon, you are not sick.", "This is, but you are not.", "Sheldon, don't you think you're overreacting?", "I'm going back to bed.", "What for?", "I mix pancake batter in this!", "You had time to make a label for everything in this apartment, including the label maker, but you didn't have ten seconds to make one that said urine cup?", "Huh.", "I guess I owe the Betty Crocker company a letter of apology.", "Hey.", "I'm at work.", "Yes.", "Yes.", "They asked me to come in.", "They texted me.", "No kidding?", "Alright, well, get some rest and drink plenty of fluids.", "Drink whatever you want.", "Then make soup.", "Yes,", "Yes, they're training dogs to operate the centrifuge for when they need dogs to operate the centrifuge for blind scientists, I have to go.", "Howard, it's Leonard, code Milky Green.", "Affirmative, with fever.", "Howard, listen to me.", "No, don't, don't....", "I tried to stop you.", "You call Koothrappali, we need to find a place to lay low for the next eighteen to twenty four hours.", "Five movies, two hours apiece.", "It's a start.", "Oh, hi Penny!", "I'm... uh... at work.", "I'm... uh... in a... I'm in a radiation suit.", "What's up?", "Sheldon's at the Cheesecake Factory.", "(Into phone) Just tell him to go home.", "Uh, yeah, I'd be... I'd be happy to Penny.", "(Holds phone up, Howard makes warning siren noises) Oh my God there's a breech in the radiation unit (Raj joins in) The whole city is in jeopardy, oh my God, Professor Googenfeil is melting, gotta go, bye!", "(To Howard and Raj) I feel really guilty.", "Oh dammit, my glasses.", "Okay, I'm blind here guys, can you help me find them?", "Oh great.", "Yeah, at home.",

spare glasses are in my bedroom, on my dresser, next to my Bat-signal.", "Raj?", "Well I can't do it, I can't see anything.", "Fine.", "Won't my footsteps set it off?", "Well, how do I carry it if I'm on my hands and knees?", "What?", "Then just say go straight.", "Alright (Bangs head on a trunk.)", "I just hit my head.", "It wasn't on?", "Then why did I have to crawl?", "Okay, it's on.", "I know.", "Hi!", "Well, I had to, you see what he's like.", "No!", "W-wait!", "I don't think Penny's ever coming here again.", "Yeah, so?", "If I stand, I'll vomit.", "Lay it on me.", "How about that.", "Would the new Sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old Sheldon?", "That is a problem.", "Graduate work, very impressive.", "Advantage Kim.", "Yes sir.", "A bad feeling I have about this, mmm-hmmm.", "So, Dennis, how long have you been in America.", "No kidding, you speak English really well.", "What are you talking about?", "Come on, Sheldon, we've hardly shown him anything.", "Huh, yeah?", "Come on, Dennis, I'll show you the rec centre, they've got nautilus equipment.", "Not heavy ones.", "Come on, Dennis, I'll show you the radiation lab.", "It's like looking into an obnoxious little mirror, isn't it?", "Something you'd like to share?", "A tale of woe perhaps.", "Just eat, Sheldon, you'll feel better.", "You can't let this kid get to you.", "You always knew that someday someone would come along who was younger and smarter.", "Well, what are you going to do, Sheldon, give up?", "Hey.", "Great.", "Great.", "Great.", "Okay, well, right now I'm designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level, but I really don't need any help.", "Yes.", "It would blow up.", "Pretty sure.", "Okay, Sheldon, I understand that you're going through a bit of a career crisis, you're searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive but I need to tell you something and I want you to listen carefully.", "Go away.", "If he were, I wouldn't be.", "Is that even possible?", "Like what?", "He'll never be able to cope with the fact that some fifteen year-old kid is smarter and more accomplished than he is.", "Hang on, are we talking about murdering Dennis Kim?", "I'm not saying no.", "That won't happen, he's not interested in anything but physics.", "What?", "Howard, he's fifteen.", "It's take your daughter to work day.", "Okay, so we now have a socially awkward genius in a room full of attractive age-appropriate women.", "Does anyone else see the flaw in this plan?", "No, we can't.", "Okay, we cannot leave this to chance, lets pick a girl, and figure out how to get her together with Dennis.", "Sure.", "If he wants to spend a couple of years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with non-fat White Russians, while you're the one holding her head out of the toilet while she's puking and telling you she wishes more guys were like you, and they she gets into Cornell because you wrote her essay for her, and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn't even know you.", "I think that's our girl.", "One of us should go talk to her.", "I can't just go up and talk to her.", "Howard, you talk to her.", "Well, we're not in India.", "Okay, that was uncalled for.", "The kid got a girl.", "Yeah, mission accomplished.", "Well, why do we go home alone every night, we're still smart.", "I don't know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman \"you have to frisk me, I have a rocket in my pants.\"", "Yeah, we really ruined his life.",

words to you.", "The needs of the many.", "The ladies?", "Let's put it to a vote.", "All those in favour....", "Will the gentleman from the great state of denial yield for a question?", "After we go through the exercise of an annoying series of votes, all of which the gentleman will lose, does he then intend to threaten to quit if he does not get his way?", "I move we are the Army Ants, all those in favour?", "Yes.", "Oh, uh, he'll be okay once the women are mixed into the crowd.", "He only has a problem when they're one on one and smell nice.", "I was actually the one who noticed, okay, let's just start.", "I knew that too.", "Just ask another one.", "Sheldon, you have to let somebody else answer.", "Howard, sit down.", "maybe we should take a little break.", "Can it wait, I need to talk to you.", "Why do they say AA?", "Isn't that confusing?", "AA might mean something else to certain people.", "No, I meant....", "never mind.", "Hey, check it out.", "I got you a Batman cookie jar!", "Well, you're a friend, and you like Batman, and cookies, and you're off the team.", "Howard, Raj and I just had a team meeting.", "Yes we did, I just came from it.", "Okay, let me try it this way, uh, I was at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends and one thing led to another and it turns out you're off the team.", "Because you're taking all the fun out of it.", "Okay, let me try it this way, you're annoying and no-one wants to play with you any more.", "Thanks for the heads up.", "Yes.", "He won't say.", "He just smiles, and eats macaroons out of his bat jar.", "How exactly would that laugh go?", "Guys, let's remember that Sheldon is still our friend and my room mate.", "So nothing, let's destroy him.", "Raj, we're not getting TV's Blossom to join our physics bowl team.", "We can't ask Leslie Winkle.", "Yes.", "Fine.", "Here I go, taking one for the team.", "In the sack.", "Hey Leslie.", "Leslie, I have a question for you, and it might be a little awkward, you know, given that I...", "There's not?", "Gee, cos it sure sounds like there should be.", "That's all very comforting, but if it's okay, I'd like to get on with my question now.", "We are entering the physics bowl and we need a fourth for our team.", "She's in.", "Oh, yeah.", "You know you don't have to stay for the whole thing.", "Sheldon.", "So, is that your team.", "No, it stands for Perpetual Motion Squad.", "The Eta Meson.", "Prevost's theory of exchanges.", "What the hell is that.", "Come on, think, Leslie.", "You're never going to let that go, are you?", "Sorry, I panicked.", "Hang on.",

there.", "My Physics Bowl Trophy!", "I know someone who would disagree.", "My Physics Bowl Trophy!", "(In weird voice) \"Leonard is so smart, Sheldon who?\"", "You're right, I'm sorry.", "(In voice, waving trophy in Sheldon's face) I'm not!", "What are you doing?", "Bring it on.", "How do you know these things?", "Wait, I don't think it's Shatner.", "I don't believe it.", "Some guy is auctioning off a miniature time machine prop from the original film and no-one is bidding on it.", "No, a time machine from Sophie's Choice.", "Uh-huh.", "Yeah.", "And that's my bid.", "It was a spur of the moment thing, I figured it would go for thousands and I just wanted to be a part of it.", "Not to blow on a miniature time machine.", "Come on, snipers.", "Where are your snipers?", "Snipe.", "Snipe.", "Snipe!", "SNIPE!", "Aaaa-aw!", "Yeah, I know, I still can't afford it.", "I just assumed.", "Who sells a full sized time machine for $800?", "How are we going to get it upstairs?", "Yes but the elevator's been broken for two years.", "Come on, guys, push.", "Uh, hi Penny.", "(Raj and Howard are heard to scream as the time machine slides back down the stairs.)", "Take a break, guys!", "Oh, just, you know, moving... something upstairs.", "It's... you know, time machine.", "Uh, just give us a few minutes.", "Hey, if you wait for us to set up the time machine, I can drop you off at work yesterday.", "Time travel joke, it's not... never mind.", "Let's just do this.", "Guys, ready to push?", "Yeah.", "It is by far the coolest thing I have ever owned.", "Seconded.", "That sounds fair.", "Sheldon, you can't be selfish, we all paid for it, so it belongs to all of us.", "Now out of the way so I can sit in my time machine.", "(Sits and turns it on.", "The three lights on the front illuminate.", "All let out an \"oh\".)", "Okay, I am setting the dials for March 10th, 1876.", "So, when it's your turn you can.", "Okay, I am setting the dials for January 10th, 2328.", "Here we go into the future.", "(Pulls lever, the disk begins to spin.", "The other guys all run around the flat as if moving in fast motion.)", "That was fun.", "Are you okay?", "That doesn't sound too bad.", "Sorry.", "The lights flash and the dish spins, you wanna try it?", "So?", "Because I want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine.", "Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to me?", "What if I knocked you unconscious right now?", "But it would make the present so much nicer.", "What was your first clue?", "Yes I'm upset.", "Yeah, good for you.", "I don't know.", "Maybe.", "Uh, here's the thing.", "Girls like Penny never end up with guys who own time machines.", "Thanks for pointing it out.", "Those are movies.", "Come on, guys, push.", "Uh, hi Penny.", "(Raj and Howard are heard to scream as the time machine slides back down the stairs.)", "Take a break, guys!", "Oh, just, you know, moving a... time machine.", "Don't worry baby, I've got you.", "I'm packing up all my collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell.", "It's not about money.", "Terrific, does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine?", "Because I don't want it any more.", "Just... personal reasons.", "Look, do you want to buy me out or not?", "I paid two hundred dollars for my share.", "No, no more toys or action figures or props or replicas or costumes or robots or Darth Vader voice changers, I'm getting rid of all of it.", "Not for long.", "It's not a bidding war, I'm selling it all to Larry down at the comic book store.", "He offered me a fair price for the whole collection.", "Forget it guys, if I sell to one of you, the other two are going to be really mad at me.", "Sorry Raj, my mind is made up.", "Sheldon, get out of my way.", "Okay.", "I did not want to do this but, I have here the rare mint condition production error Star Trek", "No, I needed to hear it.", "Still, I think it's time for me to get rid of this stuff and... you know... move on with my life.", "Yeah.", "Thanks.", "Hey, do you want to, I don't know, later...", "My turn on the time machine.", "Sheldon, are you okay?", "It is a little big for the living room, isn't it?", "On the other hand, some physicists are concerned that if the super collider actually works, it will create a black hole and swallow up the Earth ending life as we know it.", "Hey, check it out, the school of pharmacology is looking for volunteers.", "I don't know, Raj.", "Maybe the comic book store doesn't have a bulletin board.", "(Sees crowds in the corridor) What's going on?", "Sheldon's office?", "Is she lost?", "Maybe she's his lawyer.", "Howard...", "Oh, hey buddy.", "Sheldon, are you going to introduce us?", "You too, swell, also.", "So, how do you two know each other.", "Excuse me?", "So Missy, what brings you all the way from Texas?", "Woah, woah.", "If the wedding's not until tomorrow, why don't you stay with us tonight?", "Look, you're here, we have plenty of room.", "So it's settled.", "You'll stay with us.", "Hee-hee, just classic.", "Those are not mine.", "Yeah, no, I do, I use those... uh... just to polish up my... spear-fishing equipment.", "I spear fish.", "When I'm not crossbow hunting, I spear fish.", "Uh, Penny, this is Sheldon's twin sister, Missy.", "Missy, this is our neighbour Penny.", "I wasn't staring!", "Oh.", "Huh, um, maybe, if you like women who are tall... and perfect.", "I brought snacks.", "Onion dip, it's onion dip.", "We don't entertain much.", "Bye Missy, see you.", "Uh, yeah, no, uh, bye Penny.", "Excuse me, this is my apartment and she's my roommate's sister.", "How do I have Penny?", "In what universe do I have Penny?", "Hell, no!", "Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?", "Thank you.", "Sheldon, are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman?", "That's fascinating, but I...", "Alright, noted.", "But my point is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz... they're hitting on your sister.", "That's great, but I....", "Whatever.", "You have to do something about it.", "Because she's your sister.", "Okay, uh....", "oh, consider this.", "With your father gone, it is your responsibility to make sure that Missy chooses a suitable mate.", "Uh-huh.", "Exactly.", "And, you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of your sister's future offspring.", "He's the man of his family, you have to respect his wishes.", "Say what?", "We all make mistakes, let's move on.", "Sheldon, you are really being unreasonable.", "We all make mistakes, let's move on.", "I agree.",

catching up.", "By the way, may I speak to Missy please?", "Well, since you're leaving tomorrow I was wondering if you'd like to go out to dinner with me?", "Oh.", "You have other plans, or...?", "Oh.", "Alright uh... enjoy the rest of your evening.", "Um, here's something we didn't anticipate.", "Oh, it's called trestling.", "Forget about the cake, how did you know that my birthday is Saturday?", "Oh, I don't think so.", "I don't celebrate my birthday.", "No, it's no big deal, it's just the way I was raised.", "My parents focussed on celebrating achievements, and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them.", "Thank you.", "No.", "But it was okay.", "I mean, when I was little I'd think maybe my parents would change their mind, and surprise me with a party, like this one birthday I came home from my Cello lesson, and I saw a lot of strange cars parked out front, and when I got to the door I could hear people whispering, and I could smell German chocolate cake, which is my favourite.", "Oh, it was kind of like a birthday party.", "I got to see all my cousins and there was cake, so...7", "Howard, every Thai restaurant in town knows you can't eat peanuts.", "They see me coming they go \"ah, no peanut boy!\"", "Hey.", "Fine.", "Seen it.", "Oh.", "Pass.", "Look, I am in the Halo battle of my life here, there's this kid in Copenhagen, he has no immune system so all he does is sit in his bubble and play Halo 24/7.", "Not if you believe his doctors.", "No.", "Here you go, Copenhagen boy, how about a taste of Hans Christian Hand Grenade.",

exasperated) Okay Sheldon, what was it supposed to be?", "Fine, it's out of the washer.", "I'll call you when it's in the dryer.", "Excuse me.", "No, listen, see we're throwing my friend a surprise party and I'm supposed to keep him out of his apartment for two hours.", "No, see, the only way I could get him to leave is to tell him I ate a peanut.", "Because I'm allergic to peanuts.", "Look, all I need from you is to take me in the back and give me a band-aid so I can pretend I had a shot of epinephrine and they you tell my friend you need to keep me under observation for about an hour, hour and a half.", "Yes.", "No, you don't understand.", "Okay, I get it, I know how the world works, how about if I were to introduce you (holding up a five dollar bill) to the man who freed your people.", "Bad, very bad.", "We can't go home.", "Becauth (pretends tongue has swollen up) Becauth-th-th.", "Brissket, Brissket!", "Water, need water.", "Penny, look, I've got a problem.", "I don't think I can.", "Okay, you have to understand something, we're in a hospital right now.", "Leonard's fine.", "I'm fine, thanks for asking, by the way.", "Look, I've done my best but he wants to go home and I don't know how to stop him.", "Don't toy with me, woman.", "Pees hep me!", "Fank-u.", "I really don't think the colonoscopy was necessary.", "Oh, right, it's your birthday, I had no idea it was your birthday, I completely forgot, wow, what a lousy way to spend a birthday, well it's all over now.", "Maybe.", "Are you mad?", "Yeah, that's why I did it.", "Well it's not.", "You know, I'm really glad you decided to learn Mandarin.", "Once you're fluent you'll have a billion more people to annoy instead of me.", "You just called Leonard a syphilitic donkey.", "Not now, I have a blog to find.", "It's smashed beyond repair, what are you going to do with it?", "Apparently he posted intimate details of their physical relationship on his blog, which I cannot find anywhere.", "Good idea.", "Sit with her, hold her, comfort her, and if the moment feels right, see if you can cop a feel.", "Remember to sit on your hands a bit so they're warm.", "What, so you're saying that if in the depths of despair she throws herself at you and demands you take her, right there, right now, you'll just walk away?", "For God's sake, Sheldon, if you don't like the tangerine chicken, don't order the tangerine chicken.", "Boy, that story gets better every time you hear it.", "Oh, hey, Leonard, how was your date?", "You should thank us.", "When future generations try to determine why your relationship with Penny crashed and burned, this right here is the black box.", "No, it's like \"this fish tastes bad, so I'm going to slow down and spit it out.\"", "Oh really, did you make a second date.", "Good, 'cos they don't work.", "Let's go to the tape.", "Look at her reaction to the goodnight kiss, no change in respiration, pupils un-dilated, no flushing of the chest.", "Give him time.", "Hey, qu'est q'wass up?", "And some of those skinless chicks were hot.", "That's kind of an overreaction to a little harmless necrophilia.", "Did you buy generic ketchup, forget to rinse the sink, talk to him through the bathroom door?", "Did you make fun of trains?", "Who is it?", "Shouldn't you have put him in a brown paper bag and set him on fire?", "Maybe you'd be happier on a park bench?", "Do you want to switch?", "Get out of bed, we're switching.", "Just get in the bed!", "What's going on?", "Are you boys roughhousing?", "We're just talking ma.", "If you don't settle down right now, I'm not going to let you have any more sleepovers.", "For God's sake, ma, I'm 27 years old.", "It's not even a school night!", "(To Sheldon) Comfy now?", "So don't look at it.", "No kidding?", "What about Lee Meriwether?", "Well I'm glad that's settled.", "Please, I'm begging you, go to sleep.", "Oh for God's sake.", "Koothrappali dumped him on me, and he couldn't get to sleep, so I gave him a glass of warm milk with a handful of my mom's valium in it.", "But he still wouldn't shut up, so, tag, you're it."]}
